# WeatherApp

## Weather APIs used

> Getting all 15 individual most populous cities weather data on basic and standard plans were not avaialable on the major weather services so I found Accuweather's top 50 cities current weather API and used OpenWeatherMap's Current Weather API to get weather data for location and search requirements

### Design

> A [Model View Presenter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12_woC_iMTR3wm-wYSHWrsl6GpXDa8QoO/view?usp=sharing) design was used
 


## Testing

**issues**
Getting Jest to make snapshot tests of components went horribly wrong on dependency issues, something like this [issue on stackoverflow](http://52.65.140.135:8080/)

Redux reducers and actions were unit tested for consistency on UI updates
