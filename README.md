# WeatherApp

## Weather APIs used

> Getting all 15 individual most populous cities weather data on basic and standard plans were not avaialable on the major weather services so I found Accuweather's top 50 cities API and used OpenWeatherMap's API to get weather data for location and search requirements

### Design

> A Model View Presenter design was used



## Testing

**issues**
Getting Jest to make snapshot tests of components went horribly wrong on dependency issues

Redux reducers and actions were unit tested for consistency on UI updates
